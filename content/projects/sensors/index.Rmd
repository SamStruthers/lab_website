## What is the value of individual sensors in river networks?

<br>

There is an increasing interest to install dense networks of sensors in stream networks to help predict flow and water quality - but the questions of how many sensors and where is an open question. This project aims to link the strengths of a deep learning model and a physics-based model to quantify the value of each new sensor in the river network. This work will help inform stakeholders decide where to implement new sensors in a monitoring network to maximize the value for model predictions.
