## How vulnerable are US National Parks to water scarcity? 

<br>

This project will evaluate the influence of climate change on the security of National Park Service water supplies, beginning with parks in hydrologic settings most likely to experience supply challenges. If a water supply is found to be sensitive to climate change and projected to experience climate-related changes that will impair the supply's quantity and/or quality, adaptation actions can be undertaken to further secure that water supply (e.g., increase water conservation at the site, reduce existing losses in water transmission, increase water storage, etc.)
