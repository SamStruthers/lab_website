Sam is the Field Coordinator for the ROSSyndicate. He is currently managing two water quality studies on the Cache La Poudre River: water quality impacts of the 2020 Cameron Peak Wildfire on high elevation drinking supply reservoirs, and monitoring urban and agricultural impacts to water quality in the Poudre as it meanders through the City of Fort Collins. Sam's research interests include disturbance hydrology, stream restoration and open access water quality data. Before starting at the ROSSyndicate, Sam worked on Dr. Stephanie Kampf's Cameron Peak Fire hydrology study, comparing burned and unburned watersheds with a focus on snowpack impacts.
