Sam is the Field Coordinator for the ROSS Lab. He is currently managing a study of the water quality effects of the 2020 Cameron Peak Wildfire, focusing on impacts to high elevation reservoirs. Sam's research interests include disturbance hydrology, water quality, disturbance adaptation and open access water quality data. Before starting at the Ross Lab, Sam worked on Dr. Stephanie Kampf's Cameron Peak Fire hydrology study, comparing burned and unburned watersheds with a focus on snowpack impacts.
