Katie is the lab's data manager. Currently, Katie assists the lab on all sorts of projects, though a common thread within them is the munging and harmonizing of large datasets. Before becoming a lab manager, Katie was a fellow with the National Park Service's Water Resources Division while receiving her Master's with Matt and [Dr. Stephanie Kampf](https://www.nrel.colostate.edu/investigator/stephanie-kampf-homepage/) as her co-advisers.
