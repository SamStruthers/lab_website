B is a self-proclaimed data geek with a background in limnology, watershed science, and remote sensing. Before landing in the ROSSyndicate, B worked with Kathleen Weathers at the Cary Institute and Holly Ewing at Bates College wrangling and analyzing data for multiple aquatic systems in the northeast. They are interested in designing tools that increase access and understanding of remote sensing data to researchers as well as leveraging remote sensing data towards a greater understanding of aquatic environments.
