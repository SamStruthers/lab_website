Fred is an ecohydrologist interested in understanding how hydrologic and biogeochemical process interact across different scales to better protect our water resources. Prior to joining the lab, Fred conducted research on how various ecosystems (such as wetlands, streams, and the vadose zone) altered the transport and behavior of various agricultural contaminants.
