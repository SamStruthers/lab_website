Join us for a playful, interactive event full of art+science activities exploring the environmental impact of the 2020 wildfires! [From Burn to Bloom](https://gis.colostate.edu/from-burn-to-bloom/) will have creation stations for all-ages, opportunities for hopeful reflection, and a chance to selfie with Smokey Bear. ðŸ™‚

Last year we began gathering other Colorado State University scientists working to understand the various ways that the largest forest fires in Colorado state history have impacted our ecosystems. After three enriching transdisciplinary workshops, we have planned a public event to share these preliminary findings--and interesting facets of fire science in general--with the greater public.

To help tell these fire ecology stories and explore themes of hope, renewal, and resilience, we have paired with local artists and creative community organizations to deliver art+science experiences, encouraging attendees to make art while they learn science!

To put on this event, we partnered with our close partners [The Geospatial Centroid](https://gis.colostate.edu/) who serves as an on-campus hub for GIS and all other geospatial technology needs. They have been developing an online portal to aggregate data across the different CSU research sites within the Cache La Poudre Valley watershed here in Fort Collins. The data investigates many different fire effects, from stream riparian alteration to post-fire geomorphology, to beavers, aspens, algae and more!
